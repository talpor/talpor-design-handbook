This repository of documents uses [mkdocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate an HTML documentation.

All source documents are in the docs directory and are written using Mardown notation.

## Building

Install mkdocs:

`pip install -r requirements.pip`

To generate the page's HTML run:

`mkdocs build`

To run a local server that lets you browse the generated HTML

`mkdocs serve`
